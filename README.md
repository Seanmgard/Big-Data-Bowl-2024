# Big-Data-Bowl-2024

This is my submission to the NFL's 2024 Big Data Bowl. This project presents Gridiron Tackle Superiority (GTS), a metric for calculating the expected likelihood of making a tackle. The model employs a binomial logistic regression that considers factors like proximity to the ball, speed, and angle of pursuit to identify an individual playerâ€™s likelihood of making a tackle at every moment of the play. The implications of this metric are two-fold: First, GTS shows how tackle probabilities change in real time. The model demonstrates how split-second decisions by both the offense and defense can change those probabilities, and how players may adjust to those decisions. Furthermore, the analysis can be mapped to actual tackle statistics, offering a method of measuring pure tackling ability. In theory, a player that records more tackles than expected could be judged to have stronger pure tackling ability after accounting for circumstances out of their control like offensive play calls, defensive formations, and other factors.
